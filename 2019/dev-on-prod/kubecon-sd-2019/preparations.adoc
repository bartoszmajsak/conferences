=== Use case

Microservices cloud -> k8s -> docker / containers

> conclusion - I can't run the whole stuff on my laptop
-> points to dev cluster

(idea for my talk -> compare with old school monolith)
showing the dev cycle
- compile: 30s
- docker build
- docker push
- bounce pod
- restart

> Talk

> Questions - at any time

> openshift.io story


- wrong tooling and techniques -> slow down productivity, people will get frustrated

- anyone starting up their clusters locally?
(screenshot of my system perf + https://www.contegix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/laptop_fire_sm.jpg)
- can you really spawn all the services at once?

- potentially running against outdated services (unit tests, contract tests can potentially help here)

>>> real use case - launcher?

> principles

- write software locally using your favorite tools

- interact with other services running in the cluster

- no interference with other services / users

## Tackle some myths
https://linuxtogether.org/why-should-we-have-separate-development-testing-and-production-environments/


When jumping to microservices world we apply the same assumptions and expectations

Fallacies of distributed computing

- network and infra is reliable
- latency is zero
- bandwith is infinite
- the network is secure
- topology does not change
- transport cost is zero
- the network is homogeneous

> it gets harder to develop on such a platform



## Service Mesh in a few pictures

before istio (discovery, load balancer, resiliency, metrics, tracing)

after istio:

sidecar takes over all non-business logic

> circuit breaker
> redirecting traffic
> mirroring traffic


## How Istio-workspace work

edge vs non-edge services

## Future

- subdomains
- other connectivity strategies
  - squash
- CI 
- IDE plugins


## Hard questions

- what if you have a state 
--- virtual db / teiid - reads from prod / write to throwaway clone

- who is using such approach
-- Namely (human resources company). we were actually inspired by the talk by one of their employees






== My talk

. why dev cluster is bad idea
.. money
.. maintainance overhead
.. never the same a prod


=== Demo

Quarkus
- regular
- debug

=== Questions to be prepared for

. Why not just connecting to actual pod?
. Security constraints
